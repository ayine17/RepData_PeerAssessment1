Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

```{r}
#https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/activity.zip
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
